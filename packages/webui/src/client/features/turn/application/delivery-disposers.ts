// The delivery disposers the application actually holds.
//
// A version guard rejects a superseded attempt's commits but does not cancel its
// IO: something has to close the client's half of the delivery. That something is
// this registry — the stream/watch/request handles handed up by the transport as
// each attempt opens.
//
// What closing one means is deliberately narrow. It stops **this client**
// observing the attempt: no further frames are delivered and the wire session is
// closed. It never aborts the host turn, and it never revokes an already accepted
// host mutation — cancelling those stays an explicit command (`stop`), because a
// detached observer and a cancelled turn are different things (ADR 0017).
